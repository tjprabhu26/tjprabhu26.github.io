        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Tejal Prabhu, and I am a hardworking and passionate freshman attending the
          University of California, Riverside. I am part of the Universityâ€™s Honors program and pursuing a degree in Psychology and a pre-law pathway. 
          Having volunteered for various organizations and worked for companies with the goal of helping those in need, I am always searching for
          new ways in which I can benefit the lives of others and create a positive impact in my community. My two most impactful and community-centric
          experiences revolve around tutoring, something I have involved myself in as a means of supporting other students in academic communities.<br><br>
          
          Reaching out to fellow community members and schools, I took it upon myself to facilitate a learning environment at a non-profit tutoring
          organization (Students for Students) where each student has the confidence to pursue their academic goals. By attaining an executive position
          and volunteering as a tutor, I am proud to say I helped provide supplementary academic resources to the students who did not have the means or
          foresight to seek them out themselves.Through my position as a managerâ€™s assistant at the tutoring organization KUMON, I further assisted my community's youth in their educational journeys
          working diligently to teach them core subjects such as math, reading, and writing skills. Working at the tutoring center, Kumon, where I was constantly
          surrounded by children, fostered my interest in developmental psychology. Inspired by the teachings of Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development and
          Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development, I designed a learning system based on my students' ages. While older students received firm instruction and
          verbal encouragement, my younger learners received little rewards for completing different parts of their work. To my satisfaction, gradually, their
          work started to be turned in faster. With Piagetâ€™s research on mental maturity and Kohlbergâ€™s theories on motivating factors, I was able to incentivize
          my students in a new way. Utilizing psychology in a real-world situation only increased my desire to study the field further. <br><br>

          Together with my hands-onÂ experience, I've alsoÂ worked hard to achieve academic success, keeping a high GPA and being involved in extracurricular 
          law-related activities. I'm constantly excited to increase my knowledge and abilities outside of the classroom, whether it's through club events or 
          community service. I came to realize that although I would be pursuing a career in law, selecting psychology
          as my major in college would provide the educational background necessary for me to do so. A psychology major would satisfy my intellectual curiosity
          for the subject while simultaneously equipping me with skills that I could apply while working with a diverse array of clients in unique circumstances.
          I continuously use my academic passions and my community-based mentality to better serve justice and advocate for those who need it. </p>
